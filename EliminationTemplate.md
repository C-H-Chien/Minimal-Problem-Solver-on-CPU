## Practical guide of using Elimination Template to Solve Minimal Problems
Steps of solving a minimal problem by Elimination Template are _(i)_ creating a template for the problem, and _(ii)_using the template for solving the problem. <br />

## Create a Template
- Numerous minimal problems have been included in the ``autogen_v0_5/autogen/generate_big_table.m`` file. Simply run the code with the problem of interest uncommented, and you should get the template. 
- For solving a new problem, create your own problem under ``autogen_v0_5/autogen/problems/`` and do the step above.
- For a list of included mimimal problems, refer to Table 1 of (Prof. Larsson's CVPR'17 paper)[https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Larsson_Efficient_Solvers_for_CVPR_2017_paper.html].
